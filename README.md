# MintReading
#### MintReading is a dedicated reading learning product owned by `BaiCiZhan`. By breaking each book into daily reading tasks, WeChat will be sent to you (including `text` and `audio`) in the morning. In the evening, it will push out the lecture notes of the reading content in the morning, including the new meanings of familiar words and the background introduction of the story.
